# ChiSquareX at CMCL 2021 Shared task: Leveraging recent advances in Pre-Trained Language Models for Eye-Tracking Prediction
This is our attempt of the shared task on **Predicting human reading patterns** at the [CMCL 2021 workshop](https://cmclorg.github.io/), part of the [NAACL 2021](https://2021.naacl.org/) conference.  
## Authors: Varun Madhavan, Aditya Girish Pawate, Abhranil Chandra, Shraman Pal
The workshop provides a venue for work in computational psycholinguistics, including computational and mathematical modeling of linguistic representations, development and processing. CMCL promotes the synergy between the field of Cognitive Modelling and Natural Language Processing applying methods from computational linguistics to problems in the cognitive modeling of any and all natural language abilities by the use of Cognitively inspired human-derived behavioral data, which reflect the semantic representations in the human brain to augment the neural nets to solve a range of tasks spanning syntax and semantics with the aim of teaching machines about language processing mechanisms.
